- As a manager, 
    - I want the form app to have a search or filter feature, enabling me to quickly locate specific forms or entries within a large dataset, I also want to have the form app to have security measures, ensuring that sensitive information is protected & accessible only to authorized users. I want the form app to integrate with other relevant systems or tools, such as databases/project management platforms, to streamline workflow & data management.
- As a user within the organisation, 
    - I want the form app to have clear & intuituve interface, allowing me to easily understand on how to fill & submit the forms. I want the form app to allow attachments, enabling me to include relevant documents, files or images with my form submissions. I also want the form app to sent confrimation emails upon successful form submission, providing reassurance that my submission was received. I want the form app to be easily accessible from various devices, allowing me to submit forms whether I'm at my desk or on the move.
